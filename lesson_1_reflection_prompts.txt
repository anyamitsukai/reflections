How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Less code to search through.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can manipulate and debug with more ease.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    More memory with the auto save, but less likely to do so with Git. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows more organization than Google Docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    This will show all the previous versions of your code and enable you to see all the changes between the versions. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to the previous version to review your code and change it. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
